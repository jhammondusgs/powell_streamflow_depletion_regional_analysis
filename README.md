# powell_streamflow_depletion_regional_analysis
Calculating streamflow signatures, merging with climate data, using watershed attributes to classify sites where groundwater pumping potentialy leading to streamflow reductions, and identifying sites where streamflow depletion may be occuring based on anomalies from flow vs climate relationships
